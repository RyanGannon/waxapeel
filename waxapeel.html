                <br>
                <div class="col-lg-12 desc">
                    <p>I have studied Beauty Therapy in Senior College Dun Laoghaire for two years and successfully passed my CIDESCO qualification exams in 2012. I was also the only student to receive a distinction in Advanced Waxing that year. </p>
                    <p>Over the last few years I have worked in many high end salons including "Pure Radiant", that was located in the Radisson Blu St Helens hotel, "Iconic Beauty" and also "Waxperts" in Dun Laoghaire. After gaining a strong clientele list and lots of experience in specialised waxing, I have now decided to open up my own salon to provide a professional waxing service for both men and women at an affordable price. </p>
                    <p>Located on Main Street Dundrum, the salon is easily accessible, with lots of parking and is only two minutes from the Dundrum Luas stop. Best of all I use only Waxperts Wax&trade;. This is an Irish brand and it is the most flexible and effective wax you will ever find. It is even suitable for the most sensitive of skins. </p>
                    <p>Over my years of waxing, I am proud to say that I have always followed a "no double dipping policy" when waxing clients. This means I will never re-dip any spatula back into the wax pot after applying wax to clients. Once the spatula touches the skin it is disposed of and a fresh one is used for the next application of wax. It eliminates any possibility of bacteria being transferred back into the wax pot, and reapplied on to you or the next client. This ensures the safest and most hygienic treatment for you. </p>
                    <p>So what are you waiting for? For a comfortable and hygienic wax come and visit my salon today.</p>
